# Exercise
The attached file (`discography.txt`) contains Bob Dylanâ€™s discography.

Our goal is to get a Trello board through interacting with the Trello API,  with the albums classified in lists sorted by decade. 

Each album should display its year and title and show up in the list sorted by year, and in the case of same year alphabetically. 

Additionally, we'd like each album to have the cover art if we can fetch it from Spotify.

Your solution should be able to do that from the discography file.
